DESCRIPTION

In the context of this namespace, a Wizard is defined as a graphic user
interface (GUI) that presents information, and possibly performs tasks,
step-by-step via a series of different pages.  Pages (or 'screens', or
'Wizard frames') may be chosen logically depending upon user input.

The "Tk::Wizard" module automates a large part of the creation of a
wizard program to collect information and then perform some complex task
based upon it.

The wizard feel is largly based upon the Microsoft(TM,etc) wizard style:
the default is similar to that found in Microsoft Windows 95; a more
Windows 2000-like feel is also supported (see the "-style" entry in
"WIDGET-SPECIFIC OPTIONS". Subclassing the module to provide different
look-and-feel is highly encourage: please see "NOTES ON SUB-CLASSING
Tk::Wizard".

NB: THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ALPHA SOFTWARE.  ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE WELCOME!
